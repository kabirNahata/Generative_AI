Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, creating a “greenhouse effect” that leads to a rise in temperatures. 
### Key Points: 
1. **Cause**: - The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) for energy, transportation, and industrial processes. - Deforestation, which reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO2. - Agricultural practices that generate methane and nitrous oxide emissions.
2. **Evidence**: - Rising global temperatures, with the planet's average temperature increasing by approximately 1.1°C (2°F) since the late 19th century. - Melting glaciers and polar ice caps, leading to rising sea levels. - Changes in precipitation patterns, with some regions experiencing heavier rainfall while others face drought. - Increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, and wildfires. 3. **Impacts**: - Ecosystems: Shifts in habitats and species distributions, leading to threats to biodiversity and extinction of vulnerable species. - Agriculture: Altered growing seasons, affecting food production and security. - Human health: Increased heat-related illnesses, respiratory issues due to poor air quality, and the spread of vector-borne diseases. - Economic: Damage to infrastructure from extreme weather, increased costs of disaster response, and a need for adaptation measures.
4. **Mitigation**: - Reducing GHG emissions by transitioning to renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro). - Enhancing energy efficiency in industries, homes, and transportation. - Reforestation and afforestation to enhance carbon sequestration. - International agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, aim to limit global temperature rise by reducing emissions.
5. **Adaptation**: - Developing infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather conditions. - Implementing water management strategies to cope with droughts and flooding. - Protecting and restoring natural ecosystems to enhance resilience. Global warming is a critical and urgent global issue, and addressing it requires coordinated efforts by individuals, governments, and organizations worldwide to reduce emissions and adapt to the changes that are already underway.
